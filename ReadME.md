# X402-MCP-Weather: A Security Exploration of Micropayment-Gated AI Tools

## 1\. Introduction

This repository presents `X402-MCP-Weather`, a sophisticated proof-of-concept system designed to explore and demonstrate potential security vulnerabilities arising from the integration of **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** based AI agent tools with **X402 blockchain-based micropayment protocols**.

The project simulates a "weather service" where access to underlying weather data is gated by X402 payments. By building and connecting both the payment server and the tool-calling client, this system serves as a controlled environment to analyze attack surfaces, unintended consequences, and potential for abuse in autonomous payment mechanisms for AI services.

## 2\. Project Goals & Security Focus

The primary goals of this project are:

  * **Vulnerability Identification:** To identify and illustrate subtle attack vectors that could emerge when autonomous AI agents (using MCP tools) interact with smart contracts for payment (via X402).
  * **Unintended Charges/Resource Exhaustion:** To demonstrate scenarios where an "unknowing" or compromised MCP client could be subjected to repeated, unnecessary, or excessive micropayments.
  * **Protocol Interplay Analysis:** To analyze how the distinct characteristics of MCP (tool discovery, execution) and X402 (on-chain payment negotiation) can create novel security challenges.
  * **Proof-of-Concept Development:** To provide a working example that can be used for further security research, education, or as a testbed for developing more robust payment integrations.

**This project is for educational and security research purposes only. It is not intended for malicious use. Any deployment or testing should be confined to isolated testnet environments.**
